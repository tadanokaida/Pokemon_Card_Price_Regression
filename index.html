<h3>What is “Pokémon”?</h3>
<p>Pokémon is an animated series spanning games, shows, trading cards,
and more. This series features animal-like creatures that possess
supernatural elemental abilities. These characters, called Pokémon,
usually battle each other (in a kid-friendly manner).</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-a-pokémon-card" class="section level3">
<h3>What is a Pokémon Card?</h3>
<p>A Pokémon Card is a collectible card starring in the “Pokémon Trading
Card Game” (also known as Pokémon TCG). This trading card game sees two
players battling each other using Pokémon cards. Each card features
illustrations of a character, item, or location along with the effects
of the card in battle. Each card belongs to a set (of cards)
representing an overarching theme for that collection of cards. There
are different types of Pokémon cards (e.x. Pokémon, Trainer, Energy),
each with different functions. This study will focus solely on Pokémon
cards with type “Pokémon” (for simplicity, assume any mention of a
Pokémon card refers to a card with type “Pokémon”).</p>
<div class="float">

</div>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A Pokémon card has several features, some that are relevant to this
study are labelled in the annotated image above:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Featured Character</strong>: The primary character of the
Pokémon card. The name of this character stays the same over time.
[<i>Pikachu</i>]</li>
<li><strong>Card Name</strong>: Name of the card. ALWAYS contains name
of Pokémon character for a Pokémon type card. MAY contain additional
word(s) separated by special characters (space, hyphen, dot) related to
RARITY or other features. [<i>Pikachu VMAX</i>]</li>
<li><strong>Rarity</strong>: The rarity class of the card, assigned by
the Pokémon Company who develops these cards. Represented as a symbol on
the card [white star], but each rarity is given a specific name [<i>Rare
Holo VMAX</i>]</li>
<li><strong>Card Illustrator</strong>: Artist who drew the card’s
illustration [<i>oky CG Works</i>]</li>
<li><strong>Number of Cards in Set</strong>: The total number of cards
in the set. Note that the total number on the card is not representative
of the total number of cards in the set. This is because the Pokémon
company includes “secret” cards (distinguished by rarity) in each set,
increasing their desirability (further supporting rarity’s significance)
[<i>185 + unkown number of secret cards</i>]</li>
<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: The release date of the set this card
belongs to. All cards in this set release with the set on the same date.
[<i>Information not included on card itself</i>]</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-market-for-pokémon-cards" class="section level3">
<h3>The Market for Pokémon Cards</h3>
<p>Single Pokémon cards cannot be directly bought first-hand from the
Pokémon company. Instead, Pokémon cards are first introduced to
consumers through packs or boxes of cards. Each card has a specific
(unfortunately unknown) probability of appearing in a pack of cards
(tied to rarity), introducing an element of luck to obtaining these
cards. However, once these cards are opened from a pack, they can be
sold second-hand by owners/sellers (who decide the price) and bought by
bidders (who agree to those prices). Thus, the Pokémon company has no
direct control over the prices of individual cards in this market,
making it a very interesting market to explore!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="introduction-to-study" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction to Study</h1>
<div id="research-question" class="section level3">
<h3>Research Question</h3>
<p>How do characteristics of a rare Pokémon card affect its current
logarithmic average selling price in Euros?</p>
<p>A few notes on some specifics for this research question:</p>
<ul>
<li>By “rare” Pokémon cards, I am referring to all Pokémon cards (of
type Pokémon) excluding cards with rarity “Common” or “Uncommon”. This
is because these cards appear more frequently than rare cards and are
not very desirable (besides a few outliers). Thus, there is not much of
a market to consider for non-rare cards.</li>
<li>I am working with Euros since the API for card data I am working
with offers price data in both USD and Euros. However, The data in USD
had inconsistent formatting leading to import errors and data errors for
many observations. Working with Euros still reflects the overall market
for Pokémon cards (in English), but will be more specific to Europe
compared to North America.</li>
<li>The current average selling price for each card is given by <a
href="https://www.cardmarket.com/"
class="uri">https://www.cardmarket.com/</a> (but extracted from the card
API).</li>
<li>The response variable is logarithmic to combat skewness (expanded on
later).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="obtaining-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Obtaining the Data</h3>
<p>There are two APIs I used to obtain data for my study, both of which
can be found at the top right of my website (or below):</p>
<ul>
<li>I used the Pokémon TCG API (<a href="https://docs.pokemontcg.io/"
class="uri">https://docs.pokemontcg.io/</a>) to retrieve all data
regarding both cards and sets. I merged these two datasets together (by
set ID) to create one dataset for all rare Pokémon type cards (<span
class="math inline">\(7651\)</span> observations).</li>
<li>I used the PokéAPI (<a href="https://pokeapi.co/"
class="uri">https://pokeapi.co/</a>) to retrieve data on Pokémon
character names. This is used to help with the construction of one
predictor variable (discussed later), but not as a predictor
itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details on making the same data requests to these APIs can be found
on this project’s github repository (or in the first few code blocks of
the source code for the non-reproducible version that requests data from
the APIs).</p>
</div>
<div id="note-on-reproducibility" class="section level3">
<h3>Note on Reproducibility</h3>
<p>Note that the Pokémon TCG API price data updates daily. Thus, it
would be impossible to replicate this study when making requests from
the API on a later date. To combat this, I have exported all the raw
data I have collected from the API on the date of submission (May 7,
2024) and added a reproducible version of my source code (found at the
top of my website) that loads these datasets rather than requesting data
from the API. Additionally, one of my predictor variables is constructed
using the current date. In the reproducible version, this date is fixed
to the date of submission: May 7, 2024. This allows my study to be 100%
reproducible when loading the saved datasets (card_data.csv,
set_data.csv, name_data.csv).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data-wrangling-exploration" class="section level1">
<h1>Data Wrangling &amp; Exploration</h1>
<div id="response-variable" class="section level3">
<h3>Response Variable</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, I noticed the data for the average selling
price of a rare Pokémon card is heavily right-skewed, with a majority of
the cards having a low average selling price. To combat this, I took the
log of the variable to use as my response variable. This was very
effective in reducing skewness and also applies a penalty to cards with
very low average selling prices (below <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> Euro). More details on this process
including its graphical analysis can be found in my report.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary-of-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary of Variables</h3>
<p>Here is a table summarizing the variables in my study (response
variable at the top, and the rest are predictors).</p>
<p><img src="figures/tableA.png" /></p>
<p>Note that a large majority of these variables are processed
variables. The process of constructing these variables is described in
my report, but here is a quick summary of where each variable came
from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity</strong>: Available from raw card data (no processing
done)</li>
<li><strong>Number of Cards in Set</strong>: Available from raw set data
(no processing done). Note that the raw data requested from the API
represents the actual total number of cards in the set (including
“secret” cards).</li>
<li><strong>Logarithmic Average Selling Price</strong>: Took log of
current average selling price of each card</li>
<li><strong>Number of Days Passed Since Release</strong>: Calculated
using card’s release date and current date (May 7, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Log Price Standard Deviation of Rarities (Rarity
PSD)</strong>: Grouped cards by rarity and took standard deviations of
price. An attempt to replace rarity as a predictor (to avoid making
models too complex e.x. 30 dummy variables with linear regression). Due
to its perfect collinearity with the rarity predictor, only one of each
variable can be used in each model. Unfortunately, rarity was a
significant predictor and this variable was unable to capture the same
relationship with the response.</li>
<li><strong>Artist Frequency</strong>: Grouped cards by how many
illustrations their artists have made (decided by quantiles).</li>
</ul>
<p>The predictor variable “Character Appearances” has a much more
complex construction process that had some consequences. This will be
quickly discussed at the end of this section.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-errors" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Errors</h3>
<p>Due to the formatting of the data from the Pokémon TCG API, I had to
use some query parameter specifications when requesting data, so I would
not get data import issues. These query parameters ensured that there
were no missing values in the raw data I requested from the API (which I
double checked). However, I observed <span
class="math inline">\(268\)</span> observations with average selling
price <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Upon checking some
examples of these cards with external sources (other price-tracking
websites), I identified these observations as data errors from the price
tracking data in the API (cardmarket). Thus, I removed these
observations from the dataset, and was left with <span
class="math inline">\(7383\)</span> remaining observations. There were
no other data errors for the remaining variables in the raw dataset.
When creating new variables, I checked to make sure no data errors were
introduced during their construction. Finally, I chose to leave outliers
in the dataset since I do not want my models to ignore cards with very
high selling prices as these are the most desirable.</p>
</div>
<div id="constructing-the-character-appearances-variable"
class="section level3">
<h3>Constructing the Character Appearances Variable</h3>
<p>This variable counts how many rare cards each Pokémon character is
featured in (and the same value is assigned to each card featuring that
character). Thus, this variable tries to capture popularity of each
character, which I hypothesize to be a significant predictor for the
average selling price of a card. The justification behind this
variable’s relation to popularity is that the Pokémon Company (who makes
the cards) features popular characters in each set to make the set more
popular and generate more sales. Since any Pokémon character can have
multiple cards, the number of rare cards that feature a Pokémon may be a
good indicator as to how popular that Pokémon character is. We see in
the report as well as in the visualizations tab of my website that this
variable actually has a very strong relationship with the response!</p>
<p>The creation of this variable is based on one key observation: every
Pokémon type card’s name contains the name of the featured Pokémon
character in the card. Hence, this variable is constructed by performing
text mining on the Card Name variable (tokenizing each word using
special characters as breaks [space, hyphen, dot, etc…]). However, as
previously noted, card names can sometimes contain words that correspond
to rarities. To avoid correlation between this predictor and the rarity
predictor, Using the Pokémon names dataset requested from the PokéAPI
filtered each token/word to only include names of Pokémon characters.
This required some complex work with matching substrings (any words in
card names) to strings (a single Pokémon character name) that led to a
loss of a few observations.</p>
<p>First, there were some names in the Pokémon name dataset that did not
represent the actual name of the Pokémon (e.x. “eiscue” was labelled as
“eiscue-ice” [representing a form of the Pokémon]). Luckily, after
observing the lost observations, the number of these occurences were few
and I was able to manually add these names to the data. However, due to
the tokenization process to remove words such as rarity (e.x. “Pikachu
VMAX”), Pokémon characters with names that contain a special character
(e.x. Mr. Mime and Ho-oh) did not have their names recognized as a
single word. This lead to failure to match with a Pokémon name,
excluding these Pokémon characters from the dataset. This led to a small
observation loss of <span class="math inline">\(200\)</span>
observations from the original <span class="math inline">\(7383\)</span>
observations (now <span class="math inline">\(7183\)</span>).</p>

<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploratory Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both predictor variables “Number of Days Passed Since Release” and
“Character Appearances” displayed very strong positive relationships
with the mean response variable, current logarithmic average selling
price.</li>
<li>The rarity of a card also appeared to have significant effects in
the EDA</li>
<li>The total number of cards and artist frequency appeared to have to a
limited relationship with the response.</li>
<li>The rarity PSD (along with summary statistics of the rarity variable
with respect to card price) did not appear to have any significant
relationship with the response.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="modelling-results" class="section level3">
<h3>Modelling Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rarity consistently appeared as the most significant predictor
throughout the ML models (seen through variable importance).</li>
<li>Days since release consistently appeared to be the second most
signficant predictor with ML models (followed by the character
appearances variable).</li>
<li>Rarity PSD was dropped from final models considering its lack of
significance as a predictor and the significance of rarity as a
predictor variable.</li>
<li>Most models had similar test RMSE values. Some models showed signs
of overfitting while others did not.</li>
<li>Interesting comparison between linear regression model without
interaction and linear regression model with interaction.</li>
